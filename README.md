# IRfun
Iterative Regularization with Matrix Functions (Matlab)

The code in this repository is discussed in the paper:
- < Inserire qui >

So if you use it please cite the work together with:
- Hansen, Per Christian; JÃ¸rgensen, Jakob Sauer. AIR Tools II: algebraic iterative reconstruction methods, improved implementation. Numer. Algorithms 79 (2018), no. 1, 107--137. 
- Gazzola, Silvia, Per Christian, Hansen, James G. Nagy. IR Tools: a MATLAB package of iterative regularization methods and large-scale test problems. Numerical Algorithms (2018), 1-39.

On which this code is largely based, and that are needed to run the code an the test examples.
